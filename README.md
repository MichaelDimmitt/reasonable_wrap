<br>in life, when you look in between two mirrors you see realities recursion.
<br>realities recursion has a stack limit.
<br>limited by the tool you are looking through. 
<br>in this example, your human eye. 
<br>if you took a picture,
<br>the limiting tool... pixilation of the camera.
<br>you could improve the tool ... a telescoping microscope.

allowing proof that more exists. 
<br>you could capture this information in a new photo
<br>that this new device is able to capture.

when you go to print.
<br>this printer implements 10000 pixels.
<br>the detail captured by your telescoping microscope is 2000000 pixel detail.
<br>the printer prints what it can.

conclusion, you can be limited positively by the input device. 
<br>or limited positively by the printing device.

conclusion, any device switch can be controlled to end recursion.
